## overview
a standalone python package that implements dna-based genetic algorithms for evolving trading strategies.

## core components

### 1. dna encoding
- base-4 encoding using a, c, g, t nucleotides (0, 1, 2, 3)
- triplet codon translation system (64 possible codons, 0-63 value range)
- codon to trading parameter mapping:
  - Define clear mapping schemas for different parameter types (integers, floats, categories, booleans).
  - Utilize non-linear or logarithmic scaling for parameters with wide ranges (e.g., indicator periods, stop loss distances).
  - Map codon ranges to discrete choices for categorical parameters (e.g., operator types: <, >, ==).
- variable-length chromosome support via explicit start/stop codons per gene.
- regulatory sequences:
    - Promoter codons: Influence the probability of a gene being expressed (transcribed).
    - Enhancer/Silencer codons: Modulate the effect of expressed genes (e.g., scale parameter values up/down).
    - Conditional codons: Activate/deactivate genes based on market regime or other state variables (requires context injection during decoding).
- exploration of alternative encodings:
    - Grammatical Evolution (GE): Evolve rules based on a formal grammar, potentially allowing more complex and structured strategies.
    - Neuroevolution: Evolve neural network weights or architectures encoded in DNA for strategy components.

#### detailed encoding scheme
- each nucleotide represented as 0-3 (a=0, c=1, g=2, t=3)
- triplet codons map to values 0-63 for parameter encoding
- example mapping:
  - aaa (000) → value 0
  - aat (003) → value 3
  - gct (213) → value 39
  - ttt (333) → value 63
- parameter scaling applied to map 0-63 range to actual parameter values (e.g., linear, logarithmic, categorical mapping).
- start/stop codons: atg/taa (or similar unambiguous triplets) to mark gene boundaries.
- special regulatory codons: specific triplets designated for promoter, enhancer, silencer, or conditional functions.

#### codon usage
- redundant coding (multiple codons map to same value)
- allows for silent mutations that maintain functionality
- frequency bias in codons creates "mutation hotspots"
- introns (non-coding sequences) allow structural variation

### 2. gene types
- entry rule genes: conditions that trigger trade entry
- exit rule genes: conditions that trigger trade exit
- risk management genes: stop loss, take profit, position sizing, trailing stop parameters
- indicator genes: technical indicators with configurable parameters (period, source, smoothing)
- time filter genes: valid trading hours, days, sessions, specific date ranges
- **order management genes**: specify order type (market, limit, stop), time-in-force (day, gtc), limit offset
- **regime filter genes**: activate/deactivate strategies based on market conditions (e.g., volatility index level, moving average slope, adx value)
- **adaptive parameter genes**: modify parameters of other genes based on context (e.g., widen stop loss in volatile markets)
- meta genes: higher-level strategy control (e.g., max trades per day, max concurrent positions)

#### entry rule gene structure (conceptual)
```
[promoter codon(s)] [start codon] [gene type id] [indicator details] [operator] [threshold details] [timeframe] [stop codon]
      [aag]             atg            001         rsi(period=14)      <         const(30)        5m        taa
```
- *promoter codons*: Optional sequence influencing expression probability.
- *indicator/threshold details*: Could be constants, references to other indicator genes, or outputs from adaptive genes.

#### example gene structures
- moving average crossover gene:
```
[promoter]atg[type:entry][indicator:ma(5)][operator:cross_above][indicator:ma(20)][timeframe:5m]taa
# conceptual representation, actual encoding uses codons
```
translation: when 5-period ma crosses above 20-period ma on 5-minute chart, express entry signal (probability influenced by promoter).

- rsi condition gene:
```
[promoter]atg[type:entry][indicator:rsi(14)][operator:below][threshold:30][timeframe:1h]taa
```
translation: when rsi(14) drops below 30 on 1-hour chart, express entry signal.

- risk management gene:
```
[promoter]atg[type:risk][sl_mode:ticks][sl_value:50][tp_mode:ticks][tp_value:150][trail_mode:ticks][trail_start:100][trail_step:25]taa
```
translation: set stop loss at 50 ticks, take profit at 150 ticks, start trailing after 100 ticks profit with 25 tick trail step.

- regime filter gene:
```
[promoter]atg[type:regime_filter][indicator:vix][operator:above][threshold:25][action:deactivate_strategy]taa
```
translation: if the vix is above 25, deactivate this strategy.

### 3. genetic operations
- **crossover operations**:
  - single-point and multi-point crossover (at codon boundaries for structural integrity).
  - uniform crossover: exchange individual codons/nucleotides with a fixed probability.
  - gene-level recombination: swap entire valid genes between parent chromosomes.
  - segment crossover: swap contiguous segments of the chromosome, potentially spanning multiple genes or partial genes.
  - **semantic geometric crossover (SGC)**: generate offspring parameters that lie geometrically between parent parameters in the phenotype space (requires decoding, interpolation, re-encoding).
  
- **mutation operations**:
  - point mutations (single nucleotide changes: A <-> T, C <-> G, or any random change).
  - codon substitutions: replace an entire codon with another, potentially changing the encoded value or function.
  - gene insertion/deletion: add/remove entire valid genes (requires careful handling of chromosome length and indices).
  - regulatory sequence mutations: alter promoter/enhancer codons to change gene expression probability or modulation.
  - **biased codon mutation**: mutate codons preferentially towards functionally similar values or based on observed codon usage frequencies.
  - **frameshift mutation**: insert/delete single nucleotides, shifting the reading frame (potentially disruptive, use sparingly or within non-coding regions).
  - **inversion**: reverse the order of a segment within the chromosome.
  - **translocation**: move a segment of the chromosome to a different location.
  
- **advanced operations**:
  - gene duplication: create copies of existing genes, allowing for subsequent specialization through mutation.
  - intron insertion/splicing: dynamically add/remove non-coding sequences, affecting chromosome length and potentially mutation impact.
  - **epigenetic modifications (simulated)**: introduce temporary changes to gene expression (e.g., methylation tags) that are not directly encoded in DNA but can be inherited for a few generations, allowing faster adaptation to transient market conditions.
  - **homeotic gene regulation**: introduce genes whose primary function is to control the expression (activation/deactivation) or parameters of *other* specific genes or gene families.

#### operation probability control
- adaptive mutation rates:
    - increase rates when population fitness stagnates.
    - decrease rates when fitness is rapidly improving.
    - link rates to population diversity metrics (e.g., increase mutation if average hamming distance drops below a threshold).
    - potentially use self-adaptive rates encoded within the chromosome itself.
- adaptive crossover rates: adjust based on population diversity and effectiveness of crossover operations.
- targeted mutation: apply higher mutation rates to specific gene types (e.g., parameter tuning genes) or underperforming individuals.
- context-aware mutation: restrict mutations to maintain biological plausibility (e.g., keep indicator periods positive, ensure stop-loss > 0).
- operator scheduling: dynamically change the probability of using different types of crossover/mutation during the evolutionary run.

#### practical examples
- point mutation:
  - atg001rsi30below1htaa → atg001rsi20below1htaa (threshold change)
- gene duplication:
  - adding copy of successful gene with slight variation
- regulatory mutation:
  - changing expression probability of a gene 
  - altering gene activation conditions

### 4. population management
- initialization:
    - combination of random dna sequences and pre-defined templates/seeded strategies.
    - ensure initial population covers a diverse range of parameter values and structures.
- selection methods:
    - standard: tournament selection, fitness proportional (roulette wheel) selection.
    - advanced: 
        - **lexicase selection**: select parents based on performance across multiple fitness cases (individual trades or market periods), promoting generalists.
        - **multi-objective selection**: use algorithms like nsga-ii or spea2 for sorting populations based on pareto dominance.
- diversity preservation mechanisms:
    - **genotypic diversity**: maintain variation in dna sequences.
        - fitness sharing: penalize individuals in crowded regions of the genotype space.
        - crowding: replace individuals with the most similar ones in the population.
        - measure using hamming distance or edit distance.
    - **phenotypic/behavioral diversity**: maintain variation in strategy behavior.
        - **novelty search**: reward strategies that exhibit unique trading patterns or explore new areas of the behavioral space, even if not immediately profitable.
        - **quality-diversity (qd) algorithms**: e.g., map-elites. simultaneously optimize for high performance and behavioral diversity, mapping strategies onto a feature space (e.g., trade frequency vs. risk).
        - measure using behavioral characterization vectors (e.g., avg holding time, trade frequency, risk/reward ratio).
- adaptive mutation and crossover rates (as detailed in genetic operations).
- population structure:
    - **island model (multi-population ga)**:
        - maintain multiple sub-populations evolving in parallel.
        - define migration policies (frequency, number of migrants, selection of migrants).
        - potentially use different evolutionary parameters per island.
        - allows for specialization and exploration of different search space regions.
    - **hierarchical or cellular gas**: structure population spatially.
- **speciation/niching**: automatically group similar individuals (species) and adjust selection/reproduction within niches to protect novel solutions.

#### diversity metrics
- genotypic: average/minimum hamming distance, allele frequencies.
- phenotypic: 
    - based on performance metrics (sharpe, drawdown, profit factor).
    - based on behavioral characteristics (trade frequency, holding time, risk exposure patterns).
    - parameter space coverage analysis.
- ancestry tracking: visualize evolutionary lineages.
- niche formation detection: monitor clustering in genotype or phenotype space.

#### population dynamics
- age-based culling: remove older individuals to encourage exploration.
- immigration/emigration policies for island models.
- dynamic population sizing: adjust size based on performance or diversity.
- elitism: preserve the best individuals, potentially balanced with diversity mechanisms (e.g., keep best + most novel).
- integration of novelty search or qd components alongside fitness-based selection.

### 5. fitness evaluation
- backtesting engine interface (integration with backtesting library/framework).
- **primary approach: multi-objective optimization (moo)**:
    - aim to find a pareto front of non-dominated solutions balancing multiple conflicting objectives.
    - utilize algorithms like nsga-ii or spea2 for ranking and selection.
    - objectives typically include maximizing profit/return, minimizing risk/drawdown, and potentially maximizing behavioral diversity (if using qd).
- performance metrics calculation:
    - **core objectives**: 
        - total net profit / average annual return.
        - risk-adjusted return (sharpe ratio, sortino ratio, calmar ratio, omega ratio).
        - maximum drawdown (absolute and percentage).
        - profit factor.
    - **secondary metrics/constraints**: 
        - win rate / average win / average loss.
        - trade frequency / average holding period.
        - volatility of returns.
        - recovery factor.
        - statistical significance of results (e.g., p-value from t-test).
- **trading rule compliance (critical constraint / objective)**:
    - **hard constraint**: solutions violating any rule are assigned zero or minimum fitness.
    - **objective**: minimize rule violations (less ideal, prefer hard constraint).
    - **intra-backtest checks**: 
        - simulate daily loss limit checks during the backtest run.
        - simulate trailing maximum drawdown (overall loss limit) checks.
        - verify compliance with scaling plan rules (contract size changes based on profit thresholds).
        - track consistency metrics required by the ruleset.
- multi-objective fitness functions (returning a vector of objective values).
- rigorous overfitting prevention:

#### performance metrics (detailed examples)
- primary objectives:
  - net profit/loss
  - sharpe ratio (or sortino for downside deviation)
  - maximum drawdown (% or absolute)
  - potentially: average trade p&l, profit factor (can be secondary)

- compliance rule constraints/checks (applied during or post-backtest):
  - daily loss limit violation check (per day)
  - trailing maximum drawdown violation check (continuously updated)
  - profit target achievement (relevant for evaluation steps)
  - minimum trading days / consistency rules
  - scaling plan compliance (adjusting contracts based on simulated equity curve)

#### overfitting prevention
- **walk-forward optimization (wfo)**: 
    - divide data into multiple sequential in-sample (is) and out-of-sample (oos) periods.
    - evolve strategies on is, test on immediate oos period.
    - potentially use anchored or unanchored windows.
    - assess stability of performance across multiple wfo runs.
- **cross-validation for time series**: 
    - employ methods like purged k-fold cv or combinatorial purged k-fold cv to handle temporal dependencies and avoid lookahead bias.
- **monte carlo simulation**: 
    - perturb initial conditions, data order, or add noise to assess strategy sensitivity.
    - generate distributions of performance metrics.
- **robustness testing**: 
    - **parameter sensitivity analysis**: test performance with slight variations in evolved parameters.
    - **market regime sensitivity**: evaluate performance across different pre-defined market conditions (trending, ranging, high/low volatility).
    - **cost sensitivity**: test with varying slippage and commission assumptions.
- **complexity penalty**: 
    - penalize strategies based on the number of active genes, total chromosome length, or computational complexity.
    - use information criteria (aic, bic) or minimum description length (mdl) principles as a basis.
    - incorporate into a fitness objective or use as a secondary ranking criterion.
- **hold-out validation**: reserve a final, unseen period of data for validating the selected pareto front solutions from wfo/cv.

#### fitness function example (conceptual moo)
```python
def calculate_fitness_objectives(strategy_dna, historical_data, compliance_rules):
    # decode dna to strategy
    strategy = decode_strategy(strategy_dna)
    
    # run backtest with integrated rule checking
    results = backtest(strategy, historical_data, compliance_rules)
    
    # check for hard constraint violations
    if results['hard_rule_violation']:  # e.g., hit trailing drawdown
        # return worst possible objective vector
        return [-infinity, infinity, ...] 
    
    # calculate objectives
    net_profit = results['net_profit']
    max_drawdown = results['max_drawdown'] # minimize this (positive value)
    sortino_ratio = results['sortino_ratio'] # maximize this
    # ... other objectives ...
    
    # complexity penalty (can be an objective or applied later)
    complexity = calculate_complexity(strategy_dna)
    
    # return objective vector (note signs for maximization/minimization)
    # example: [profit, -drawdown, sortino, -complexity]
    return [net_profit, -max_drawdown, sortino_ratio, -complexity]

```

## api design

### encoding & core structures
```python
# example usage
from dna_trading_strategy.core import dna, gene
from dna_trading_strategy import encoding

# create a random dna sequence
seq = dna.random_sequence(length=120)

# decode dna sequence to a list of gene objects (or a full chromosome)
chromosome = encoding.decode_chromosome(seq)

# access gene details
for gene_instance in chromosome.genes:
    print(gene_instance.gene_type, gene_instance.parameters)

# encode a chromosome back to a dna sequence
new_seq = encoding.encode_chromosome(chromosome)
```

from dna_trading_strategy.genes import factory
from dna_trading_strategy.core.structures import chromosome

# create an rsi entry gene using a factory
rsi_gene = factory.create_gene(
    gene_type="entry_rule",
    config={
        "indicator": "rsi",
        "parameters": {"period": 14},
        "condition": "below",
        "threshold": 30,
        "timeframe": "1h"
    }
)

# create a risk management gene
risk_gene = factory.create_gene(
    gene_type="risk_management",
    config={
        "stop_loss": {"mode": "ticks", "value": 50},
        "take_profit": {"mode": "atr_multiple", "value": 3.0}
    }
)

# combine genes into a chromosome
strategy_chromosome = chromosome([rsi_gene, risk_gene])
```

### evolution process
```python
# example usage
from dna_trading_strategy import evolution
from dna_trading_strategy.fitness import evaluation
from dna_trading_strategy.population import population, selection
from dna_trading_strategy.operators import crossover, mutation
from dna_trading_strategy.utils import config_loader

# load evolution parameters and compliance rules from config
params = config_loader.load_config('config/evolution_params.yaml')
compliance_rules = config_loader.load_config('config/compliance_rules.yaml')

# setup backtesting interface (specific to chosen library)
backtester = setup_backtester("path/to/data") 

# create fitness evaluator with multiple objectives and constraints
fitness_evaluator = evaluation.MultiObjectiveEvaluator(
    backtester=backtester,
    objectives=params['fitness']['objectives'], # e.g., ['net_profit', '-max_drawdown', 'sortino']
    constraints=compliance_rules
)

# create initial population

```

### backtest integration (conceptual)
```python
# assumes a backtesting interface class exists
from dna_trading_strategy.backtesting import interface
from dna_trading_strategy import encoding

# load historical data (implementation depends on source/library)
data = interface.load_data("databento", symbol="gc", start="2022-01-01", end="2023-01-01")

# create backtest engine instance
# config might include account size, commissions, etc.
engine = interface.BacktestEngine(data, config=backtest_config)

# get a chromosome (e.g., from evolution results)

## integration with main project
- import package in flask application
- use api to create and evolve strategies
- store evolved strategies in database
- visualize strategies in web interface
- allow manual tweaking of strategies

## implementation considerations
- **performance optimization**: 
    - fitness evaluation is the bottleneck. parallelize backtests extensively (multiprocessing, joblib, dask, ray).
    - optimize dna decoding/encoding.
    - efficient data handling and caching.
    - consider compiled extensions (cython, numba) for critical loops if needed.
- **backtesting fidelity**: 
    - accurate simulation of slippage, commissions, latency, and order fill logic is critical.
    - careful handling of lookahead bias in indicators and rule evaluation.
    - robust integration with the chosen backtesting engine.
- **parallelization & distribution**: 
    - support for running evaluations across multiple cores/machines (island model naturally fits).
    - investigate frameworks like dask or ray for distributed ga runs.
- **state management**: 
    - ability to save and resume long evolution runs (serialization of population, random states, etc.).
    - checkpointing at regular intervals.
- **reproducibility**: 
    - meticulous management of random seeds for ga operators and potentially within the backtester.
    - versioning of code, data, and configuration for reproducing results.
- **configuration management**: 
    - flexible system for defining evolution parameters, objectives, constraints, gene configurations (e.g., yaml + pydantic).
- **testing**: 
    - comprehensive unit tests for all components (encoding, genes, operators, selection).
    - integration tests for the evolution loop and backtester interaction.
    - property-based testing (e.g., hypothesis) to check operator invariants.
    - tests for compliance rule logic.
- **dependency management**: keep dependencies minimal and well-defined.

## potential research directions / future enhancements
- **interactive evolution**: allow human input to guide the evolutionary process.
- **co-evolution**: evolve strategies and their evaluation criteria (e.g., market regimes) simultaneously.
- **learning classifier systems (lcs)**: integrate rule-based machine learning techniques.
- **fuzzy logic integration**: incorporate fuzzy rules or parameters.
- **transfer learning**: transfer knowledge (e.g., useful gene structures) between different instruments or timeframes.
- **dynamic dna structure**: allow the structure of the dna (e.g., codon mapping) to evolve.
- **real-time adaptation**: mechanisms for strategies to adapt online during live trading (requires careful simulation).
- **explainable ai (xai)**: develop methods to better understand *why* evolved strategies make certain decisions.
