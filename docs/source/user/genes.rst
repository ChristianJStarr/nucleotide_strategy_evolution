==========
Gene System
==========

This guide explains how genes are defined and used in the Nucleotide Strategy Evolution framework.

.. note::
   This documentation is a placeholder and needs to be completed with detailed information about gene types, gene expression, and gene implementation.

Gene Types
---------

The framework supports various gene types, each controlling a different aspect of trading strategies:

* **Indicator Genes**: Define technical indicators and their parameters
* **Rule Genes**: Define entry and exit conditions
* **Risk Management Genes**: Define stop-loss, take-profit, and position sizing rules
* **Filter Genes**: Define time-based or market regime filters
* **Order Type Genes**: Define order execution types (market, limit, etc.)

Gene Expression
-------------

The expression of genes determines how strongly their encoded properties affect the strategy:

* **Promoter Regions**: Regulate gene expression levels
* **Codon Bias**: Some codon patterns may affect gene expression
* **Gene Order**: The order of genes can affect their interactions

Creating Custom Genes
------------------

To implement a new gene type:

1. Define the gene type in the gene registry
2. Implement decoding logic for the gene parameters
3. Implement the gene's effect on strategy behavior

.. code-block:: python

    # Example implementation will be added here

Integration with Strategy Execution
---------------------------------

When a strategy is executed:

1. Genes are decoded from the DNA sequence
2. Each gene contributes its functionality to the strategy
3. The combined effects of all genes determine the strategy's behavior
